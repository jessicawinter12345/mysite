            <h1>7/5/2024</h1>
            <p>Today is the day I decided to start talking about the things I have been thinking.</p>
            <p>Allow me to introduce myself, My name, or at least I wish it was, is Jessica. That is what I will be going by on here.</p>
            <p>I created the about me page for you to learn about me if you would like. I on the inside believe I should be a girl, but there are so many outside factors that I will never get to be who I want to be.</p>
            <p>For now, I will just live it in my mind and with all of you. Feel free to come along for the ride.</p>
            <p>I have the house to myself today so I decided to wear my cute cheerleader costume from Halloween a few years ago, since it was Halloween I could get away with it without having to answer questions but it was so nice to be able to go out dressed all cute</p>
            <p>Today is just a short little post because we are just getting going but come back for more soon</p>
            <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Quick update - Ordered this cute skirt on Amazon, it is weird for me to buy clothes but I love the feeling so I can sometimes make myself do it.</p>
