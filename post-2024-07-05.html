            <h1>7/5/2024</h1>
            <p>Today is the day I decided to start talking about the things I have been thinking.
                Allow me to introduce myself, My name, or at least I wish it was, is Jessica. That is what I will be going by on here.
                I created the about me page for you to learn about me if you would like. I on the inside believe I should be a girl, but there are so many outside factors that I will never get to be who I want to be.
                For now, I will just live it in my mind and with all of you. Feel free to come along for the ride.
